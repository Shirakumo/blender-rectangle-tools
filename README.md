# Rectangle Tools for Blender
This is a repository that contains an addon for Blender to conveniently and quickly draw rectangular geometry. This allows a very fast workflow for building maps.

## Installation
You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/Shirakumo/blender-rectangle-tools/releases/latest/) of our plugin directly here from GitHub. The zip file can be imported into Blender just like any other addon.

Activating the `Rectangle Tools` addon should give you a new tool in object and edit modes.
